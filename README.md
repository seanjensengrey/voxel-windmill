# A Voxels Scene in 180 lines Taichi Renderer!

Recently, I've learned about rendering, and knew Dr. Hu's [Taichi voxel renderer](https://github.com/yuanming-hu/voxel-art). I went to Beidaihe for a tour several weeks ago and took some pretty photos. Inspired by one of the photos of the windmill and the voxel-art, which was very beautiful and clean, I spent some time creating a scene during the Spring Festival. For convenience, the code is 180 lines in total. If possible, the code will continue to be reduced to less than 100 lines in the future.

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

And then use your mouse and kyeboard to control the camera according to the help message in terminal. **But Remember that I'm running with a GPU cause it's faster to render. If you don't have one or want another device, go to `scene.py` to change it.**

* Drag with your left mouse button to rotate
* Press W/A/S/D/Q/E to move
* Press P to save screenshot

First are my photographs, then rendering pictures.
